
activitylabels:       contains the activity_labels.txt" file with the activity names
features:             contains the "features.txt" file with the variable names
           
test:                 contains the "test/X_test.txt" file
testlabel:            contains the "test/y_test.txt" file with the activities occuring when the data were collected
testsubject:          contains the "test/subject_test.txt" file with the information about the subject gathering the data

train:                contains the "train/X_train.txt" file
trainlabel:           contains the "train/y_train.txt" file with the activities occuring when the data were collected
trainsubject:         contains the "train/subject_train.txt" file with the information about the subject gathering the data


testcomplete:         combines test, testlabel and testsubject

traincomplete:        contains train, trainlabel and trainsubject

datamerged:           contains the testcomplete and traincomplete files
                      - datamerged  also got properly named variables from the features file.


subsetindex:          identifies the mean and std variables in the datamerged dataset that sum up the results by activities.

subset:               contains only the mean and std variables identified with the subsetindex
                      - the activity variable in subset identifying the activity occuring gets proper names for the diffrent
                        factors from the activitylabels file
 
groupedmean:          sums up the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

groupedmean is the tidy dataset that is saved as a .csv file at the end of the run_analysis.R file
